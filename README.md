# 05-Third-Party-APIs-Work-Day-Scheduler

This day planner app uses moment.js to colour code the hour blocks on the planner according to the styling in styles.css.

The code is quite simple and clean. More complex code is needed to create html via js. But this simple design still works with much less code.

I added a second js file for the clock function in the jumbotron. I initially did this so I could work on the rest of the code without the clock update function stalling. 

This app meets all acceptance criteria outlined in story.md

Things to improve
- the page is not fully reponsive so doesn't look good on a mobile.
- the styling could be improved to make the user experience more appealing.
